# Challenge-1

This is the new and updated code for HW 1. I have defined all possible divs and labeled all images making the code more readable and easier to make future changes to in the future. I look to the value of this homework by making all of my code easy to understand and comprehend not only for myself but for future coders who will have to work on my code.
